mahjong
=======

Simple java project for using in tutorials.

Project shows the interactive mahjong field where the player can remove matching tiles.

## Requirements

The project was initially build with Java 7. 
At the time of writing it is still the case, but the releases after the 0.2.1 won't work with old java versions. A target version for the project is a current LTS - java 17.

## Running

Build the project using maven:

```shell
mvnw clean package
```

Run the desktop client of the game:

```shell
java -jar desktop-client/target/desktop-client-*-with-dependencies.jar
```

## Contributing

You should probably find something more interesting than a project abandonned for 10 years :)
